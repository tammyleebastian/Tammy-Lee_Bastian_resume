              <br> 
              <p>  I graduated with a National Senior Certificate from Parow High School in 2014, with an overall

              <p>
                   During my 5 year high school career I excelled academically, particularly in my Grade 12 year during which I was
                   selected by my English teacher to participate in the De Beers National English Olympiad in 2014. This 
                   participation earned me a silver award. I also obtained the sixth-class position in the Top 10 of Grade 12
                   Class of 2014 at school for outstanding academic performance. </p>

              <br> 
              <p>  I graduated with a Bachelor of Education degree from the University of the Western Cape, in 2019, 
                   with highest distinction, Summa Cum Laude, with a calculated academic average of 83%.  </p>
              <p> 
                   During my four year tenure at university, I specialized in Language and Life Orientation Education, particularly
                   its teaching methodology to Senior Phase (Grade 7-9) learners. Some of my subspecializations and modules included
                   Language and Communication Studies, Education Practice, Introduction to Educational Psychology and 
                   Childhood Development, Teaching Method of English and Life Orientation. </p>
              <p>
                  I was also awarded a Dean's Merit Certificate for exceptional academic achievement from the Education faculty,
                  consecutively in 2016, 2017 and 2018. Additionally, I received a bursary award from the Department of Arts 
                  and Culture in 2017 for outstanding performance in Language and Communication Studies.  </p>

        <li>  <b> HYPERIONDEV

              <br> 
              <em> Software Engineering Certification: </em> </b>  &nbsp; Jan 2022-Present </li>
              <br>
              <p> I commenced my software engineering bootcamp at HyperionDev in January 2022, which I am expected
                  to complete by August 2022. I currently have an overall average of 98%. </p>

              <p>
                  During my time at HyperionDev I have learnt to master basic programming principles including variables, 
                  data and control structures and object-oriented design patterns and exception handling techniques to write 
                  robust computer programs in Java and Python capable of handling unexpected errors and exceptions. </p>

              <p>
                  I have also successfully completed 3 Capstone Projects in Python which includes building a loan 
                  and bond calculator system and designing an advanced task management system. Additionally, I have completed
                  4 Capstone Projects in Java, which includes the application of refactoring, exception handling, external data and
                  basic Java principles to design an advanced project management system for a structural engineering company - 
                  a program which interacts with a database. </p>
              <p>
                 I am currently in the process of completing my final level of the bootcamp, in which I am learning more about 
                 Data Science, System Design and Architecture, Database design in Java and Python. I also enrolled for a 
                 Database MasterSkills Programme, which will commence after the completion of my bootcamp. This programme
                 will enable me to gain a better comprehension and practically equip me to effectively design, develop and 
                 implement databases.  </p>
