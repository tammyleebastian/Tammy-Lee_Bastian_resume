    <h1> </b> ABOUT ME </b></h1>

    <p> Hi there, everyone! I am Tammy-Lee Bastian, a multifaceted 26-year-old, 
        filled with drive and determination, constantly seeking new challenges
        and opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills in order to thrive 
        in the world of work. </p>
        <br>
    <p> I hold a Bachelors Degree in Education and have more than 3 years of experience in 
        teaching various subjects, ranging from Afrikaans FAL to Mathematics and Creative Arts. 
        I am currently completing a bootcamp in Software Engineering at HyperionDev. 
    </p>
        <br>
    <p> Although I enjoyed engaging with and enriching young minds, I made the decision to pursue
        a career in software engineering, as the back-end design and architecture of software 
        systems have always fascinated me and I have no doubt this career will provide the perfect 
        opportunity for me to showcase and hone my logical and problem-solving skills while also 
        cognitively challenging and stimulating me.
    </p>
        <br>
    <p> Aside from my academics and professional life, 
        I enjoy reading, watching movies and spending time
        with family. I also enjoy traveling and playing educational games, such as Sudoku to keep my brain
        sharp! ;)
    </p>
